 *  Revision 1.9  2007-03-08 23:28:35  ambrmi09
 *  Minor changes made in TinKer headers for TiNa code ceneration to work
 *
 *  Revision 1.8  2006-12-12 10:57:05  ambrmi09
 *  This adresses the second part of #1609064
 *
 *  Revision 1.7  2006/11/05 19:06:03  ambrmi09
 *  Buildsystem adjusted to permit configuration of components.
 *  Now when component is enabled it will also be included in the build
 *  (instead of just sanity-tested in the source files).
 *
 *  Also a feature for application sanity is assed. When a header-file is
 *  included in the application, a check against the component it belongs
 *  to will be performed. That way user don't need to rely on run-time
 *  checks and can get feedback much earlier.
 *
 *  Revision 1.6  2006/04/08 10:15:58  ambrmi09
 *  Merged with branch newThreadstarter (as of 060408)
 *
 *  Revision 1.5.2.1  2006/04/03 20:07:23  ambrmi09
 *  Minor cosmetic change
 *
 *  Revision 1.5  2006/03/05 11:11:24  ambrmi09
 *  License added (GPL).
 *
 *  Revision 1.4  2006/02/22 13:05:46  ambrmi09
 *  Major doxygen structure modification. No chancge in actual sourcecode.
