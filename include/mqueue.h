This file was donated courtesy of the Zoi project (year 2000,
SIEMENS Elema). It was originally written as a wrapper for
pThreads-win32, to give Windows threads the ability of POSIX RT queues.

 *  Revision 1.12  2007-03-08 23:28:35  ambrmi09
 *  Minor changes made in TinKer headers for TiNa code ceneration to work
 *
 *  Revision 1.11  2007-03-03 23:01:32  ambrmi09
 *  Added driver support for FIFO's
 *
 *  Revision 1.10  2006-12-12 10:57:05  ambrmi09
 *  This adresses the second part of #1609064
 *
 *  Revision 1.9  2006/11/05 19:06:03  ambrmi09
 *  Buildsystem adjusted to permit configuration of components.
 *  Now when component is enabled it will also be included in the build
 *  (instead of just sanity-tested in the source files).
 *
 *  Also a feature for application sanity is assed. When a header-file is
 *  included in the application, a check against the component it belongs
 *  to will be performed. That way user don't need to rely on run-time
 *  checks and can get feedback much earlier.
 *
 *  Revision 1.8  2006/04/08 10:15:57  ambrmi09
 *  Merged with branch newThreadstarter (as of 060408)
 *
 *  Revision 1.7.2.1  2006/04/03 20:07:22  ambrmi09
 *  Minor cosmetic change
 *
 *  Revision 1.7  2006/03/17 12:20:02  ambrmi09
 *  Major uppdate (5 days hard work)
 *
 *  - Finally tied up all loose ends in the concept. Threads are now
 *  joinable
 *
 *  - Corrected one error: compacting scheduele while cancelling a
 *  threads
 *
 *  - Several new API, mainly concerned with cancelation (corrsp pThread
 *  also)
 *
 *  - Found a nasty bug while creating threads in threads for XC167. TOS is
 *  really a patchy solution ;( This one had to do with the compiler
 *  being fooled by the inline assembly and optimized something that was not
 *  optimizable (saving stack segment got wacked).
 *
 *  - Designed a concurrent qsort test-app. This is good for showing
 *  boss-worker model. Number of threads recoed on XC167 was 50 and on MSVS
 *  more than 150! Interesting to notice was that TinKer creation and
 *  cancelation for threads was much faster than Windows own (20-30 times
 *  faster).
 *
 *  - A MSVC workspace for pThreads-Win32. Good for testing apps
 *  transparency.
 *
 *  - Increased memory on XC167 (phyCore HW). now 32k for stacks and 16k for
 *  malloc. We still lack RAM that is not deployed (pHycore has
 *  128k + 256k physical RAM memory i think). Maximum for
 *  stack is 64k however (type of pointers determine this). If memory is
 *  increased further, we get a TRAP_B saying bad memory interface. Typical
 *  error for config memory issues in DaVe.
 *
 *  Revision 1.6  2006/03/05 11:11:24  ambrmi09
 *  License added (GPL).
 *
 *  Revision 1.5  2006/02/23 11:34:59  ambrmi09
 *  - Improved post mortem
 *   - Fixed bug in i2hex2.
 *   - Added uptime output
 *   - mark running among RDY threads in schedule dump
 *
 *  - \ref putchar now supports easy switching between serial0 and serial1
 *
 *  mqueue.h and mqueue.c should be untouched. But trying to identify if
 *  qsort is the reason for TinKer sometimes to hang (recent possible bug).
 *
 *  Revision 1.4  2006/02/22 13:05:45  ambrmi09
 *  Major doxygen structure modification. No chancge in actual sourcecode.
 *
 * Revision 1.4  2006/02/22 13:05:45  ambrmi09
 * Major doxygen structure modification. No chancge in actual sourcecode.
 *
 * Revision 1.3  2006/02/21 22:10:31  ambrmi09
 * - Added wrapper macro for pthread_create so that posix threads get named in
 *   TinKer (makes post-mortem easier). Very cool solution with a macro...
 * - Improved post-mortem, the schedule gets dumpt also now
 * - Wrapper macros for msleep and usleep (temporary)
 * - Minor stubbing and wrapping of mq_unlink and pthread_cancel
 * - Added a new test program (t est-posix.c ). This is verifyed to compile and
 *   run on both Linux and TinKer unmodified!
 *
 * Revision 1.2  2006/02/20 15:22:00  ambrmi09
 * Documentation stuff. No code changes.
 *
 * Revision 1.1  2006/02/17 21:16:16  ambrmi09
 * Initial commit: code donated by the Zoi project (author: Michael Ambrus)
