Below will do the same thing but it's safer (undefining the others is too crude

What the below setting does is preventing newlib headers to include
the sys/features file, which is __rtems__ only specific and which sets
_POSIX_THREADS among other pthread retated things.

 *
 *  $Log: tk_ansi_dirwrap.h,v $
 *  Revision 1.6  2007-03-03 23:01:32  ambrmi09
 *  Added driver support for FIFO's
 *
 *  Revision 1.5  2007-02-26 14:16:53  ambrmi09
 *  1) Drivers    - structure added
 *  2) Filesystem - in progress
 *
 *  Revision 1.4  2007-02-24 14:27:16  ambrmi09
 *  * i386-hixs-elf compiles and links properly
 *
 *  Revision 1.3  2007-02-24 12:17:14  ambrmi09
 *  1) Sync PowerPC sources
 *  2) Add structure for i386-hixs-elf target. (Hopefully our new test-bed)
 *     for developping the filesys component.)
 *
 *  Revision 1.2  2007-02-19 17:34:37  ambrmi09
 *  Tinker will now compile for target powerpc-hixs-rtems
 *
 *  Revision 1.1  2006/11/21 17:19:39  ambrmi09
 *  Moved tk_ansi_dirwrap to public directory (applications without TinKer sources needs also wrapping)
 *
 *  Revision 1.8  2006/10/09 17:08:06  ambrmi09
 *  * Sceleton for bfin and powerpc now compiles.
 *  * Refingnemen in auto-tools to build correct BSP depending on toolchain and settings
 *  * BFIN,bfin macro work-around
 *
 *  Revision 1.7  2006/04/08 10:16:02  ambrmi09
 *  Merged with branch newThreadstarter (as of 060408)
 *
 *  Revision 1.6.2.2  2006/04/03 20:07:29  ambrmi09
 *  Minor cosmetic change
 *
 *  Revision 1.6.2.1  2006/04/03 15:21:48  ambrmi09
 *  All targets updated with the new thread-starter (alternative 2).
 *
 *  This alternative has one weakness (explained elsewhere togeather
 *  with alternative 1), but so far it's the only one that will compile
 *  and function equally among all 4 (very different) compilers currently
 *  tested against: GCC, MSVC, BC5 and Keil.
 *
 *  If nothing else turns up, I'm willing to overcome the drawback (it's
 *  quite handleable) because it *truly* takes away a lot of pain with
 *  porting.
 *
 *  The ARM port (architecture level) is than's to this now fully operational
 *  without the r13 hack in the context switch. This includes thread
 *  cancellation and thread argument passing (which were not functioning in
 *  the old port).
 *
 *  If this revised code proves itself (i.e. no surprises turns up) then
 *  TinKer can be considered "almost ported" to any HW target that GCC is
 *  ported for :D (/cheers)
 *
 *  Revision 1.6  2006/03/27 13:40:15  ambrmi09
 *  As part of the preparation for the first release, code has been cleaned up a little
 *  and project has been checked that it will build on all it's intended targets.
 *
 *  Problems that remained had to do the ANSI wrapping.
 *
 *  Some modifications were neserary to make the BC5 build, but the result is cleaner
 *  and more consistent with the rest of the wrapping. As a consequence, stdlib.h was
 *  introduced.
 *
 *  Revision 1.5  2006/03/05 11:11:27  ambrmi09
 *  License added (GPL).
 *
 *  Revision 1.4  2006/03/04 19:32:35  ambrmi09
 *  Modified sources to allow build GNU targets transparently.
 *
 *  Revision 1.3  2006/03/04 14:28:44  ambrmi09
 *  Finally got the \ref clock() representation right. Now timing is
 *  behaving equaly between the targets X86_Linux, Cygqing, MSVC, BC5 and
 *  XC167.
 *
 *  Revision 1.2  2006/03/02 14:05:50  ambrmi09
 *  Posting to GNU toolchain started
 *
 *  Revision 1.1  2006/02/28 18:40:11  ambrmi09
