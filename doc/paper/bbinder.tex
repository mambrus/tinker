\chapter{Foreword}
\label{FIXME}
	TinKer is a real-time kernel for very small targets. The work behind TinKer is a summary of ideas that has been in my head for more then 15 years. I finally desided to write them down\ldots

	This paper is intended for an novice audience, curious to get an insight and understanding of what that "beast with many names", ticking somewhere in your computer really is.

	Many thanks to my lovely whife \AA sa and to my kids, who's stood by me insipte of the many long night's and incomeless monts during the completion of this work.
