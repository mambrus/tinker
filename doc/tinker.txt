@mainpage TinKer - A Tiny Kernel for small embedded targets

   This is the main-page for TinKer - A Tiny Kernel for small embedded
   targets

   @section INTRODUCTION INTRODUCTION

      The kernel is divided into:
      - \ref COMPONENTS- <em>"Components"</em> add some ability to the
      kernel and are
      totally independent of any other entity except it's parent

      - \ref PACKAGES - <em>"Packages"</em> are the <em>"glue"</em> that makes the
      above possible

/** @defgroup COMPONENTS COMPONENTS: TinKer components
@ingroup TinKer
@brief This Doxygen "module" define TinKer "components"
@ref main

      You can compile the kernel with or without a
      component by modifying each components main macro. 
      Some of them depend on others, so you need to know the dependency for each.
      You select/deselect each component by a YES or NO in the section 
      <b>//Include components</b> in tk.h.
       
      - SCHED          - Always selected, you cant select or deselect this one. This contains 
                         the inner most part of the kernel.

      - ITC            - Native Inter thread
      communication/synchronization (pSos API)

      - PTIMER         - Preemptive timers. Not all targets support this so you might need 
                         to disable this component.

      - PTHREAD_SCHED  - pThreads API regarding the threads

      - PTHREAD_XXX    - pThreads API... and so on (TBD) maybe SEM, TIME or just one big one?
