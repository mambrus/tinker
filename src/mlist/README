MLIST
=====

This source stems from the SAMPLER/mlist project (GPL) and is used in
SAMPLER and Tinker as an essential component.

MLIST is decoupled from SAMPLER and will be made either separate project to
accommodate both projects or a sub-project to TinKer as the build-system is
better suited for component based C-code.

It can be built either as a library or used as a module. Library is
preferred, either .so or as for TinKer, incrementally linked (i.e. no
optimization based on removal is done until final link).
